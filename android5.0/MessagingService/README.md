Messaging Service Sample
==========================

This sample shows a simple service that sends notifications using NotificationCompat.
In addition to sending a notification, it also extends the notification with a CarExtender 
to make it compatible with Android Auto. Each unread conversation from a user is sent 
as a distinct notification.

Introduction
------------

#### Flow
MessagingFragment is shown to the user. Depending on the button clicked, the MessagingService is
sent a message. MessagingService in turn creates notifications which can be viewed either on the
device or in the messaging-simulator.

When a message is read, the associated PendingIntent is triggered and MessageReadReceiver is called
with the appropriate conversationId. Similarly, when a reply is received, the MessageReplyReceiver
is called with the appropriate ConversationId. MessageLogger logs each event and shows them in a
TextView in MessagingFragment for correlation.

Instructions
------------

* Launch the application
* Tap any button to send conversations
* Read the message and observe the application registering the event
* Clear the log and tap any button to send additional conversations

Build Requirements
------------------
Using this sample requires the Android SDK platform for Android 5.0 (API level 21).
